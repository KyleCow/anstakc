\subsection{Replete and locally weakly contractible topoi}
Throuought this section the word "topos" refers to the category of sheaves on some site 
\begin{definition}[Replete Topos]
    A topos $X$ is \textit{replete} if epimorphisms are closed under sequential limits, that is for a functor $F:\N^{\op} \to X$ with epimorphic transition maps $F_{n+1}\twoheadrightarrow F_n$, then the map $\lim F \to F_n$ is epic for each $n$
\end{definition}

% good properties of these
% can pass to over category
% exactness of produts
% limits are exact in a sense i dont quite understand, lim F = Rlim F, i suppose after we identify X->D(X)
\begin{definition}
    An object in $a$ a topos is called
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compact if the "underlying geometric structure" is compact, ie if the geometric morphism $X/a \to \operatorname{Sh}(*)=\mathbf{Set}$ is proper
        \item Stable if for all morphisms $Y \to X$ with $Y$ compact, the domain of the kernel pair $R \rightrightarrows Y$ of $f$ is also compact
        \item Coherent if it is compact and stable
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Locally Weakly Contractible Topos]
    An object $F$ in a topos $X$ is called weakly contractible if every epimorphism $G \twoheadrightarrow F$ has a section. We say that $X$ is \textit{locally weakly contractible} if each $a \in X$ admits an epimorphism $\bigsqcup Y_i \twoheadrightarrow X$ with $Y_i$ coherent and weakly contractible
\end{definition}
