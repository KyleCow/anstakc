\subsection{Replete and locally weakly contractible topoi}
Throuought this section the word "topos" refers to the category of sheaves on some site 
\begin{definition}[Replete Topos]
    A topos $X$ is \textit{replete} if epimorphisms are closed under sequential limits, that is for a functor $F:\N^{op} \to X$ with epimorphic transition maps $F_{n+1}\twoheadrightarrow F_n$, then the map $\lim F \to F_n$ is epic for each $n$
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $X$ is replete then for $x \in X$, $X/x$ is replete
        \item $X$ is replete if and only if there is a surjection $x \to 1$ and $X/x$ is replete
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    To prove $(1)$ we observe that the canonical functor $X/x \to X$ preserves sequential limits and epimorphisms so in $X/x$ an epi sequential limit corresponds to an epi sequential limit in $X$ and the maps $\lim F \to F_n$ are epi in $X$ and hense epi in $X /x$

    To prove $(2)$ we note that $(1)$ proves the forward direction, then for the other direction the map $g\colon x \to 1$ induced a base change map $g^*\colon X \cong X/1 \to X/x$ defined by $t \mapsto (t \times x \to x)$ which preserves limits and epimorphisms so the same argument at $(1)$ applies
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}[Exactness in replete topoi]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For $X$ a replete topos and $H\colon F \to G$ a map in $\operatorname{Fun}(\N^{op},X)$ where the components $h_i\colon F_i \to G_i$ and the induced maps $(f_{i+1},h_{i+1})\colon F_{i+1}\to F_i \times_{G_i}G_{i+1}$ are epimorphisms for all $i$. Then $\lim F \to \lim G$ is an epimorphism\footnote{\color{red}can this be reduced to $F_0 \to G_0$ surjective and the product thing?\color[HTML]{756244}}
        \item Countable products are exact in a replete topos
        \item If $X$ is a replete topos then the functor of $N^{op}$-indexed limits has cohomological dimension $1$
        \item If $X$ is a replete topos and $F:\N^{op} \to \mathbf{Ab}(X)$ is a diagram with $F_{n+1} \to F_n$ surjective for every $n$ then $\lim F_n \cong R\lim F_n$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    To prove $(1)$ Take any $A \in X$ and any map $s\colon A \to \lim G$ we want to find an epimorphism $A' \to A$ that lifts $s$. To do so we construct a tower of epimorphisms \[\dots \to A_i \to A_{i-1} \to \dots \to A_0 \to A\]
    Such that there are maps $t_n\colon A_i \to F_i$ that lift the maps $s_n\colon A \to G_i$. We can construct one as follows, due to the fact that the pullback of an epimorphism is an epimorphism in a topos let $X_0 = X \times_{G_0}F_0$ we get an epimorphism $X_0 \to X$ that lifts $s_0$, we can continue inductively with $X_{i+1}=X_{i} \times_{F_i \times_{G_i} \times G_{i+1}} F_{i+1}$. Diagramatically 
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{A_{i+1}} & {F_{i+1}} \\
	{A_i} & {F_i \times_{G_i} G_{i+1}} & {F_i} \\
	A & {G_{i+1}} & {G_i}
	\arrow["{t_{i+1}}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[two heads, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{(f_{i+1},h_{i+1})}", two heads, from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{(t_i, s_i \circ\pi_i)}", from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\pi_i}", two heads, from=2-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[two heads, from=2-2, to=3-2]
	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=2-2, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{h_i}", two heads, from=2-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{s_{i+1}}", from=3-1, to=3-2]
	\arrow["{g_{i+1}}", from=3-2, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Since $X$ is replete taking the limit over this tower gives an epimorphism $\lim A_i \to A$ so that $s$ factors through $h$, that is 
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{\lim A_i} & {\lim F} \\
	A & {\lim G}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[two heads, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Taking then $A=\lim G$ and $s=id$ proves the claim
\newline
This allows us to prove $(2)$ quite simply as products are already left exact so we just need to check that for epimorphisms $h_n: F_n \to G_n$ we have $\prod_n F_n \to \prod_n G_n$ is epi. This follows from $(1)$ by taking $\prod_n F_n = \lim \prod_{i < n} F_i$ and noting that finite products preserve epis already and the map \[\prod_{i < n+1} F_i \to \prod_{i < n} F_i \times _{\prod_{i < n}G_i}\prod_{i < n+1}G_i\] Can be checked to be epimorphic using the internal language of the topos as the fiber product is just $\{((g_0,...,g_n),(f_0,...,f_{n-1}))\vert g_i=h_if_i\}$ so surjectivity is clear
\newline
To prove $(3)$ we've already shown that the product agrees with the derived product so for any limit for a diagram with $t_n:f_{n+1} \to f_n$ we can write it as the limit of 
\[
\prod_n F_n \to^{t-id} \prod_n F_n
\]
Hense giving an exact triangle
\[
R \lim F_n \to \prod_n F_n \to \prod_n F_n \to
\]
and so as the products are concentrated in degree $0$, $R\lim F_n$ is concentrated in degrees $0,1$
\newline
To prove $(4)$ then we use the same exact triangle from before
\[
R \lim F_n \to \prod_n F_n \to \prod_n F_n \to
\]
It suffices to show that this $t-id$ is surjective as then $R\lim F_n$ will be concentrated in degree $0$. For the sake of making this easier to read we suggestively define $F_n = G_n$ and $t-id$ is assumed to be a map 
\[
\prod_n F_n \to \prod_n G_n
\]
So maps $F \to G$ are defined by this, and maps $F\to F,G \to G$ are understood to be identities/projections .The surjectivity of $t$ means that the map induced by $t-id$
\[
\prod_{i \leq n+1} F_i \to \prod_{i \leq n} G_i
\]
is surjective as we can show this inductively using the internal language. Additionally as we did before the induced map 
\[
\prod_{i \leq n+2} F_i \to \prod_{i \leq n+1}G_i\times_{\prod_{i \leq n}G_i}\prod_{i \leq n+1}F_i
\]
Is also surjective, this means by $(1)$ the whole map is surjective
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    An object in $a$ a topos is called
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compact if the `underlying geometric structure' is compact, ie if the geometric morphism $X/a \to \operatorname{Sh}(*)=\mathbf{Set}$ is proper
        \item Stable if for all morphisms $Y \to X$ with $Y$ compact, the domain of the kernel pair $R \rightrightarrows Y$ of $f$ is also compact
        \item Coherent if it is compact and stable
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\color{red}I dont understand this notion so this section is hard\color[HTML]{756244}
\begin{definition}[Locally Weakly Contractible Topos]
    An object $F$ in a topos $X$ is called weakly contractible if every epimorphism $G \twoheadrightarrow F$ has a section. We say that $X$ is \textit{locally weakly contractible} if each $a \in X$ admits an epimorphism $\bigsqcup Y_i \twoheadrightarrow X$ with $Y_i$ coherent and weakly contractible
\end{definition}
% what are postnikov towers
\begin{proposition}
    Let $X$ be a locally weakly contractible topos. Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item X is replete
        \item The derived category $D(X,\Z)$ is compactly generated
        \item Postnikov towers converge in the associated hypercomplete $\infty$-topos
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $X$ is a replete topos, then $D(X)$ is left-complete
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
    Let $f\colon A_\bullet \to A$ by a hyper cover in a replete topos $X$, then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The adjunction $id \to f_* f^*$ is an equivalence on $D(A)$
        \item The adjunction $f_! f^* \to id$ is an eqivalence on $D(X)$
        \item $f^*$ induces an equivalence $D(X) \cong D_{cart}(X_\bullet)\subset D(X_\bullet)$ where $D(X_\bullet)$ is the derived category of the simplicial topos defined by $X_\bullet$ and $D_{cart}(X_\bullet)$ is the full subcategory spanned by cartesian complexes 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
